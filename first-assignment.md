>Markdown is a way to style text on the web.

What us a growth mindset?  In my humble opinion its an ideealogy that at its most basic principle encourages education through rigourous trial and error.  Throughout this first day, I have plenty of examples of this.

* I have had to uninstall Ubuntu three times already just so that I can rename my pc through updating the .profile so I can bring the root to windows in a much more efficient manner.
  
* I have constantly been having to check my characters in my code to make sure I am running the right processes in the terminal.  The color coding has been helpful in some of the writing.
  
* The feeling of helping others through your own failures is another example of reminding yourself the importance.
