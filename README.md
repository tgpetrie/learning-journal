---------------------------------------------------------------------
Git -- a version control system- it keeps track of a history to everything you do to your files
	
  gives the ability to view change and reply - collaboration
	
  simply a collection of things you care about
	
  maintains cohesiveness of you and peers work
Version Control
	
  snapshots in time 0 figure
	
  commits = each succesful version
	
  represent each succesive version of a file or a file
	
  commits are the Git equivalent of "Save As"
  
  Only one file		revise over time, git keeps track of where we are and where we have been
	
  term paper(1) (2).. etc
		in git its the same file

HEAD = The label meaning "you are here"
	can assign messages or comments to why we made these changes - caption or snapshot.</p>
